# Product Requirements Document: JSON to Schema Generator

**Author:** Gemini
**Version:** 1.0 (MVP)
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** Proposed

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Vision:** To be the fastest and most intuitive tool for developers to convert sample JSON data into clean, usable code for modern programming languages and validation schemas.

**Problem Statement:** Developers frequently need to create type definitions (e.g., TypeScript interfaces) or validation schemas (e.g., Zod) based on JSON data from API responses. This manual process is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to error. Existing tools can be overly complex, support too many obscure languages, or lack support for modern libraries like Zod.

**Proposed Solution:** A single-page web application that allows a user to paste a JSON object and instantly generate corresponding schemas for a curated list of popular, modern languages and libraries. The entire process will be client-side, ensuring user data privacy and instantaneous performance.

## 2. Target Audience

- **Primary:** Frontend & Full-stack Web Developers. They work with APIs daily and use modern, typed languages and frameworks (e.g., TypeScript, React, Node.js).
- **Secondary:** Backend Developers (Python, etc.) who need to quickly create data models or classes.
- **Tertiary:** QA Engineers and Technical Writers who need to understand or document API response structures.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics (MVP)

The primary goal is to provide an accurate and useful code snippet in under 10 seconds.

| Goal | Key Metric | Success Criteria (First 3 Months) |
|------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Solve the Core Task | Percentage of sessions that result in a "Copy" action. | > 70% of sessions. |
| Speed & Efficiency | Time from pasting JSON to copying the output. | Median time < 10 seconds. |
| User Adoption | Number of unique users & weekly active users. | Achieve 20,000 unique users. |
| Organic Interest | Direct/referred traffic from developer communities. | Becomes a recommended tool on Reddit, X.com, or Stack Overflow. |

## 4. Core User Flow

The user experience is designed to be frictionless and immediate.

1. **Land:** User arrives on the single-page application.
2. **Paste:** User pastes their JSON data into the input text area. A sample can be loaded with one click.
3. **Select:** User chooses their desired output format from a simple dropdown (e.g., "TypeScript").
4. **Generate:** The schema is generated and displayed in the output pane instantly as the input or selection changes.
5. **Copy:** User clicks the "Copy" button to grab the generated code. The task is complete.

## 5. Feature Requirements (MVP Scope)

### F1: JSON Input Component

- A large, focus-ready text area for pasting JSON.
- Must provide clear, real-time feedback for invalid JSON syntax.
- A "Load Sample" button to pre-fill the input with a well-structured example.
- A "Clear" button to empty the input area.

### F2: Schema Output Component

- A read-only code viewer with syntax highlighting appropriate for the selected language.
- A prominent "Copy to Clipboard" button that provides clear feedback on success (e.g., text changes to "Copied!").
- A dropdown menu to select the output schema type. The MVP will include:
  - TypeScript (Interfaces)
  - Zod Schema
  - Python (Dataclasses)
  - GraphQL Schema

### F3: Schema Generation Engine

- The core logic that parses the JSON structure.
- Must accurately infer data types (string, number, boolean, null).
- Must handle nested objects and arrays of objects correctly.
- Must generate idiomatic and clean code for the selected output type.
- All processing must happen client-side in the browser. No server-side logic is required for this feature.

### F4: User Interface (UI)

- A clean, modern, two-panel layout (input on the left, output on the right).
- The design should be utilitarian and developer-focused, with a dark theme as the default.
- Fully responsive and usable on mobile devices.
- A clear header stating the tool's purpose and its privacy-first nature (e.g., "All processing is done in your browser").

## 6. Out of Scope for MVP

To ensure a focused and rapid launch, the following will be excluded from the initial version:

- User accounts or history of conversions.
- Saving or sharing generated schemas.
- Advanced customization options for the generated code (e.g., making all properties optional, choosing between interface and type in TypeScript).
- Support for other input formats (e.g., XML, YAML).
- A public API for programmatic use.
- Additional, less common language outputs.

## 7. Technical & Design Considerations

- **Framework:** A lightweight frontend framework like Svelte or Vue, or even vanilla JavaScript, to ensure fast load times.
- **Client-Side Processing:** This is a non-negotiable requirement. It ensures user privacy, eliminates server costs, and makes the tool incredibly fast.
- **Privacy:** The UI must explicitly and prominently state that no data is ever sent to a server. This is a critical trust factor for the target audience.
- **Hosting:** The application will be a static site, hostable on services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages at little to no cost.
